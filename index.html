      <h2>OLYMPIC GAMES EXHIBITION IN TOKYO</h2>
      <p>
        As the Official Timekeeper of Rio 2016, OMEGA is set to resume its Olympic Games duties for the 27th since 1932. To celebrate the brand’s timekeeping legacy, a special interactive exhibition is being held at the Takashimaya Shinjuku Department Store in Tokyo.
        The exhibition will showcase some historic timekeeping equipment such as a split-second chronograph from 1953 that recorded time to 1/10th of a second; and the Swim-O-Matic swimming timer that was accurate to the nearest 1/1000th of a second in 1975.
        Visitors can also see the latest technological equipment such as the Scan ’O’ Vision MYRIA photofinish camera, which makes its Olympic Games debut in Rio and can capture 10,000 digital images per second.
        There is also a collection of vintage and new OMEGA Olympic Games timepieces on display.
        The exhibition runs from the 20th of July to the 2nd of August 2016.
